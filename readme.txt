Outputs a clearing &lt;div&gt;

== Description ==

Outputs a clearing &lt;div&gt;. You may configure the CSS class and height and disable inline style output. Useful when you want to ensure that a widget clears its predecessor where the predecessor's contents are dynamic. 

Simply activate the plugin and visit Appearance > Widgets to use. You may choose to disable the inline style output (if your CSS already has a clear rule). You may also specify height and the CSS class of the clear block. If not specified, the defaults are used:

* Height: 0
* Class: 'clear'

Example output (default):

`<div class="clear" style="clear:both; height:0; visibility: hidden"></div>`

== Installation ==

1. Upload `clear-widget` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Visit Appearance > Widgets
